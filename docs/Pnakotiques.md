# Pnakotiques

PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

A manuscript, 10” x 12.5” bound in pale green

leather. The cover has no title, only a peculiar

pentagram-like symbol, seared into the heavy

bindings. The title page gives the work’s name,

followed by a subtitle “As written in the so-called

Pnakotik Scrolls, as translatid from the Greke by

the author togeder with addicional remarkes

upon that worke in the light of Newe Lerning.”

The print is neat, typeset in archaic English (a

Know roll identifies it as late Middle-English). A

printer’s mark says “Trevisa et fils. 1496,” but the

binding appears to be much more recent.

Periodically plates (presumably bearing

illustrations) appear to have been carefully cut

from the book. Pencil annotations in modern

English appear frequently in the first third of

the work (usually glossing the more archaic

language), but decrease in frequency

afterwards. Anyone familiar with Roger Carlyle’s

hand will recognize the handwriting as his.



SKIMMING

This work claims to be a translation of an

otherwise unknown series of documents (The

Pnakotic Manuscripts) brought to the West after

the fall of Constantinople in 1453. These are said

to be Greek translations of even older

documents chronicling an otherwise unknown

epoch of the pre-human history of Earth. The

unidentified translator claims to have obtained

this work, also called The Pnakotik Scrolls and

The Scrolls of Pnakotus, from an unnamed

refugee from the Byzantine Empire. This

translation was made in conjunction with the

help of another (also unnamed) Greek scholar.

The body of the text is a haphazard jumble

of myths outlining the history of various

fabulous kingdoms and civilizations of Earth

before the rise of Man (as well as other places

specifically said to be not of this world).

Discussions include a catalogue of various races

in residence on the Earth during the ages before

man, the actions of various legendary figures,

and the myriad inhuman deities worshiped by

both. A final section traces the mythic history

of the book itself, from fragments uncovered in

some vast non-human library (the so-called “city

of Pnakotus”) to the scribes of vast pre-historic

human empires who consulted with improbable

“others” (some sort of flying, barrel-shaped

beings) in their efforts to understand the work.

It seems likely that this work is a compilation of

a host of mystical texts, many of which



RESEARCH

Diligent research can uncover a smattering of

references to the Pnakotic Manuscripts, but the

picture they produce is unclear at best. Each of

these items requires a successful Library Use roll

unless otherwise noted.

Multiple sources make reference to the work

in passing. One typical example comes from an

1891 counter-point review of Frazer’s Golden

Bough in the English Historical Review, which

condemns the work for “treating Christianity

and Christ in the same manner as one would

discuss Roman paganism, let alone mystical

drivel like Agrippa or the patently ridiculous

‘Pnakotica’.”

A fuller mention can be found in a portion

of the travel journals of the American explorer

Roland Godfrey, published as Expeditions in the

Arabian Peninsula, including crossing the vast

desert by camel, with visits to Mount Sinai, and

notes on the Arab people and their ways (1821):

“The Bedouins’ superstitions only

grew as we crossed that Great Sandy

void. Eight days out of Muscat, as we

prepared to camp down for the night,

several of the men spent an inordinate

amount of time in prayer, adding several

chants in something other than the

Arabic prayers they ululated so many

times. When I asked the dragoman

about this, he grew taciturn and refused

to comment. Undaunted I put the

question to him again the next day,

making rightly the assumption that the

light of day would restore the courage

the night so often saps from the less

civilized races. He told me that the men

grew fearful as we passed near the site of

the ancient city of Hiram, or Iram, which

God brought low for its sins. This fabled

city of a thousand pillars, so he related as

we rode on, was bedeviled and once the

home of dark sorcery, where fell

scriptures were studied, like the Scrolls

of Al-Banaqatiqa, a work detailing the

secrets of the Creation that was stolen by

Satan and written in the language of the

angels. Happily such melancholy talk

faded as we moved steadily closer to the

coast…”

The best description can only be found

through diligent research and comes from an

auction catalogue from the Austrian auction

house of Ausperg from 1883. It can only be

found in the largest libraries or with a successful

Luck roll at a small institution, perhaps tucked

into another work. An English copy of the work

very similar to Carlyle’s is listed thusly:

“The Pnakotic Manuscripts, English.

Published by Trevisa and Sons (London?),

1496. Bound in calf-skin, with brass

hasps and ornamentation. Work is

intact with some slight evidence of water

damage, yet with no damage to text.

Said to contain the wisdom of the

ancients, translated from Greek scrolls

now lost, this is a rare book of magic and

mysticism from the period, with a print

run in this edition of almost certainly

fewer than fifty. Of special interest to

collectors of incunabula and those with

an interest in the occult. From a private

collection. Starting bid is 200 F.”

Anyone making an Occult roll (or any

professional occultist making an Idea roll) will

recall an article in The Elder Truth, an amateur

press journal put out by a Chicago-area

Theosophist society, from May of 1921, in which

a member recounted his spirit meditations and

attempts to reach the “Hidden Lamas of

Shambalah.” In one section the author

mentions mediating upon “the wisdom of the

Pankotic texts [sic] and the Seal of Pankot [sic],”

which resulted in a terrifying vision of some

terrible lupine spirit or demon. A note at the

start of the article mourns the author’s recent

death in an automobile accident, having lost

control of his car in a high-speed turn.

A successful Anthropology roll will uncover a

reference in the Proceedings of the American

Anthropological Society (Fall, 1922) in a letter

from Derek Wheeler, an American

anthropologist conducting field research near

Lima, Peru. In a longer letter about the general

condition of the native peoples there, he

recounts the following:

“One elder in a very remote village in

the Pisco River valley recounted to me

lore from the time of the Pizarro and

how when he sacked Cuzco he destroyed

the sacred knot writings of the Incan

people, the so-called quipu. Foremost

among these were those said to have

been compiled by a legendary

quipucamayoc (scribe) named Pah-Na-

Hota, a semi-divine figure who is said to

have come from the sea just after the

creation of man. He is said to have

recounted the word of the gods and the

true history of the creation of man and

the world. This figure is an obscure one

and if any other scholars have

encountered references to Pah-Na-Hota, I

would be most interested to learn of

them.”

With a successful Cthulhu Mythos roll, the

symbol on the cover can be recognized as a

poorly done reproduction of the Pnakotic

pentagon, a powerful warding symbol.



THOROUGH READING

This book claims to be a compilation of the most

ancient texts known to some prehistoric human

civilization (or civilizations), called by the

translator Lomar, though it is unclear if this is

meant to describe a single civilization or a type

of civilization. While some attempt has been

made to keep the various fragments in

chronological order, the translator admits the

progression from most ancient to relatively

more modern is a matter of conjecture. The

translator also repeatedly reminds the reader of

the veracity of the work and expounds at length

on the history of the text he (presumably) is

translating 1. A few marginal notes indicate

which sections of the work were recorded in

“the elder script” though no examples are given

of this language.

The earliest portions discuss the earliest

days of the Earth, a fragmentary chronology of

the arrival and feats of various “gods” and races.

A catalogue of wars between the various powers

takes up much of the space, followed closely by

a chaotic and incomprehensible genealogy of

these various entities. Sometimes the translator

will preface certain sections with discussions of

other occult tomes that may clarify particularly

obtuse passages or cryptic references, although

these references are nearly as veiled and unclear

as the original material.

Despite the vagaries of the text, the author

repeatedly demonstrates uncanny (if erratic and

incomplete) knowledge of history, astronomy,

geology, chemistry, and biology for a 15th

century writer, let alone a Byzantine scholar or

even more ancient source. A passage describing

the fall of the “Elder Ones” 2 civilization relates

that fragments of their great cities persist “in

Terra Australis or the Anti-powds” and clearly

describes Antarctica (and in particular

penguins) while the chronology of the passing

of the book from one human civilization to

another conforms more closely to modern

understandings (setting aside issues like

Hyperborea) than the presumably Biblical

worldview of the translator’s period.

Some of the fragments differ markedly in

content, discussing otherwise unknown locales

such as Ulthara, Mount Hatikala, and the Sea of

Cerenarae and the apparently humans resident

there. It is unclear if they refer to yet another

unknown pre-human civilization or some

extraterrestrial location.

Certainly a more bizarre compilation of facts

and legends has probably never been seen.
